Hangman
--------

For my first project I decided to create the game Hangman. I chose Hangman because I thought the logic to behind building the game would challenge me to better my thinking skills as a programmer. Even though it was a challenge for me, the help I got really pushed me to understand the throught process to starting the game. My challenges were writing out my logic in code form and trying to figure out where to assimilate some of my code. Sometimes I would add a line of code somewhere and it would break my code, so it was a process of figuring out where exactly is the right place to add my line of code as well.

For my project the hardest part was figuring out how to add underscores and replace them with letters using the DOM. I also struggled with how to write out some of the functions to do a specific thing. I did not use any classes either. Most of my project consists of variables, arrays, and functions. My game includes names of our classmates.
